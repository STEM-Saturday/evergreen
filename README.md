An automated green space moisturizing and fertilizing system

## Description
Due to industrialization and building complex infrastructure, there are lack of green spaces available. Therefore, we decided to build a automated green space moisturizing and fertilizing system that would maintain the nutrients level of the plants. When the pH level exceeds the healthy range (becomes acidic), it indicates that the soil needs fertilizer and moisturizer which would be dispensed by the motor. The soil moisturizer sensor would transmit a signal to the arduino board to open the blockade of the pipes for 5 seconds. Afterwards, the arduino would activate the motor to dispense the fertilizer into the pipe and open the blocade.
